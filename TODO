# general
[x] refactor parallelisation setup

[x] create new parameter struct without reading from file each time
    - dont need to reset Z array as fixed variables stay fixed, variable ones change
    - do need to reset torque generators to give correct conditions (cc angle, angvel etc)

[x] compare performance of Dierckx.jl with other packages - no real difference

[] find better way to run optimisations
    - dont want to change initial_conditions.csv each time
        - new vcmx value requires u1,u2 to be recalculated
        - could break up everything into smaller functions?
    - dont want to change parallel_setip.jl to change VCMX

[] repeat stance phase optimisations


# whole stride optimisations
[] virtual second contact

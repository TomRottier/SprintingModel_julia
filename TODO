# TODO

## general

[x] refactor parallelisation setup

[x] create new parameter struct without reading from file each time
    - dont need to reset Z array as fixed variables stay fixed, variable ones change
    - do need to reset torque generators to give correct conditions (cc angle, angvel etc)

[x] compare performance of Dierckx.jl with other packages - no real difference

[] find better way to run optimisations
    - [x] dont want to change initial_conditions.csv each time
    - [x] dont want to change parallel_setup.jl to change VCMX
    - still need to chane parallel_setup.jl to change swing data

[x] add functions to calculate forces

[x] quicker way to create and run a model from results.csv

[x] repeat stance phase optimisations

## whole stride optimisations

[] virtual second contact
